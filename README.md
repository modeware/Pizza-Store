# Project 3

Web Programming with Python and JavaScript

The Pizza Store Web Site

It is a web application built using Python and JavaScript. You can fake order a pizza and recieve and email for order confirmation.
Django, a Python Framework has been used entirely and all the database models have been created using ORM, provided by Django. 

The files in the project are as follow:
1.  Orders folder contains all the main application logic.
2. static folder contains javascript file, css file and some images used in the web app.
3. template folder contains all the html files necesssary for the viewing.
4. models.py file contains class representation of all the pizza category and additionally cart and orders representation for users.
5. views.py contains different routes.

Personal Touch: I have added an email feature, once the order is placed successfully an email will be sent to the user with which the account is registered with.
